- Add .env file
- reference API Keys in .env file
- git ignore .env file 
- Push latest to repo and share repo with Matt... 
- Bring in material UI toast component and trigger it based on API success/failure
- Create another "page" in the app - name it something.  Use accordion component from Material UI to document (very briefly) the list of components in your app... (Component Name title - brief description in the body) - could also do Lorem Ipsum if you like
